### Welcome traveler âœ¨

I'm a web developer with a passion for creativity and a desire to explore different technology stacks.

In my personal life, I'm a playful and imaginative person who enjoys drawing cute things and playing ukulele. I'm also a fan of science fiction and fantasy, as evidenced by my love of Star Wars.

Overall, I value creativity, curiosity, and a sense of playfulness in both my professional and personal pursuits.
